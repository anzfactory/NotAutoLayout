/// A struct that shows a specific point in a rect.
///
/// Basically it behaves like a `CGPoint` type that has the same properties `x` and `y`, but since it's declared as another type just in NotAutoLayout, you can add any extensions you want and that won't affect the system's `CGPoint` type. For example, I have defined the addition and subtraction functions for 2 `Point` types. You can safely use them with 2 `Point`s, and they will not cause any confliction if you have defined the same functions for `CGPoint`.
